      <h2>About Juncta Juvant</h2>
      <p>
        Juncta Juvant was spontaneously conceived by a rogue AI bot trained on goetta recipes, Joey Votto’s rookie card and the Smale Commission report. Adopting Mark Twain’s totally-not-made-up quote that everything in Cincinnati happens 20 years later, this site uses cutting-edge RSS feed-and-blogroll technology to haphazardly curate the latest news from around Cincinnati.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site gets its name from the motto of the City of Cincinnati, <i>Juncta Juvant</i>, a Latin phrase that roughly translates to: <b>“When chili, spaghetti, and cheese come together, all is right with the world.”</b>
